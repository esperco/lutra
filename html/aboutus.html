	  		When we were kids, we would spend hours working. Now, we don't have enough hours in the day. Despite working 90,000 hours in our lives... we work on things that don't matter, we do not use our time efficiently.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		Executives especially have this problem, impacting the people and organizations they lead. Their assistants are the most over-worked and under-appreciated people in any organization.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		We believe that great software begins with an understanding of human behavior. We believe that people are dying the death of a thousand cuts in their work lives. We all need a solution.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		Our team has deep experience in enterprise, consumer, and mobile products. We've all built products and scaled them to millions of daily active users with hundreds of millions in revenue.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		In the future, an assistant sending a plethora of e-mails to coordinate lunch or an executive mentally overloaded will be a thing of the past. Technology will finally provide real context and enrich our relationships without the gargantuan effort needed now. We want to see a world where everyone gets the mental luxury of an assistant, including the assistant. We are making this future happen.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		We have top-tier investors, but more importantly, our team has put our own money and time in a market we believe will change the world.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		We're looking for a select few engineers who are world class at more than one thing, and who can come in and contribute at speed on day one. We run the gamut of iOS/Android, but we also use OCaml on the back-end.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		Ideal candidates are brilliant, fearless, and passionate individuals who are uncompromising in their pursuit of building an incredible product that will positively affect the lives of every human being every day.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		As teammates we value commitment and accountability; honing our craft; and seeking to learn from and understand each other.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		We are offering founding team equity and competitive salaries. Office space on University Avenue down the street from Stanford. Willing to relocate. Willing to fly you in for interviews. Willing to tell you why life's short and why secrets don't matter. Oh, did we mention every team member gets an assistant?
	  		<br /><br />
	  		We are in this for the long haul. We are not your typical SF startup. We believe that humanity will change for the better if we make technology serve us, not distract us.
	  		<br /><br />
	  		Join us as we start freeing time again for everyone on the planet. Email andrew@esper.co
	  		<br /><br />
	  		Let's get back to work.
