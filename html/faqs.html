        <h4>WHAT DOES ESPER PROVIDE?</h4>
        <p>By offloading mundane tasks to an Esper Assistant, you can better leverage your own assistant's time on more important things.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE AN ASSISTANT?</h4>
        <p>We'll provide you with your very own assistant. In addition to scheduling, our assistants are well equipped to manage tasks and plan any appointment by email or phone.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DOES ESPER WORK?</h4>
        <p>Just include us in an email, and we’ll use your preferences, correspondences, and interactions with your existing EA to gather context and complete the task.
        <br>
        <h4>CAN ESPER SCHEDULE FOR MY WHOLE TEAM?</h4>
        <p>If you're interested in having Esper Assistants for your entire team, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:allofus@esper.com">allofus@esper.com</a> for a custom pricing plan.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WILL I NEED A NEW CALENDAR?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not. We’ll update any and all of the calendars you normally use.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHICH EMAIL PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED?</h4>
        <p>We currently support emails hosted on Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Exchange, and Google Apps.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DO I JOIN?</h4>
        <p>We’re inviting all interested executives and assistants to join our beta program for a free trial. We will provide complete assistant support free of charge during the 30-day trial period, after which you will have the option to opt-in to our full service. <a href="signup"><b>Sign up here</b></a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT INFORMATION DOES MY ASSISTANT NEED?</h4>
        <p>When you sign up with Esper, we ask some simple questions about your preferences to help your Esper Assistant get to know you better. These preferences will be used as a guide to schedule all of your meetings and complete your tasks. If something is unclear, your Esper Assistant will seek clarification from you or your existing EA, guaranteeing that all meetings fit perfectly within your schedule.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT IF I ALREADY HAVE AN ASSISTANT?</h4>
        <p>Esper can free your EA from working on routine tasks so that they can focus on strategic, high-level activities. Your EA will have complete oversight of every task and will be able to provide content and context when needed. We can work with executive assistants on an individual basis to understand how we can best support them and their executive.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW CAN I CONTACT ESPER?</h4>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:allofus@esper.com">allofus@esper.com</a>.
