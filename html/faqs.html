        <h4>WHAT DOES ESPER PROVIDE?</h4>
        <p>Esper provides you with an assistant to handle all of your scheduling tasks. By using our own software platform that connects email and calendars, Esper Assistants quickly and efficiently schedule your meetings and provide you and your guests with the proper context and information, so everyone is prepared for a productive meeting.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DOES ESPER WORK?</h4>
        <p>Just include us in an email, and we’ll reach out to your peers to schedule a meeting that works for everyone. In the process, we’ll use your preferences and correspondences to gather context around the appointment then add the event to your calendar.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WILL I NEED A NEW CALENDAR?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not &#8212; we’ll update any and all of the calendars you normally use, allowing you to access all of your appointments without lifting a finger.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHICH EMAIL PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED?</h4>
        <p>We currently support emails hosted on Google Apps. However, we are in the process of developing our platform for Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DO I JOIN?</h4>
        <p>We’re currently inviting interested executives and assistants to join our beta program for a free trial. We will provide complete assistant support free of charge during the trial period, after which you will have the option to opt-in to our full service.<a href="signup.html"> <b>Sign up here</b></a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT INFORMATION DOES MY ASSISTANT NEED?</h4>
        <p>When you sign up with Esper, we ask that you fill out a short preference form so that your assistant can get to know you better. These preferences will be used as a guide to schedule all of your meetings. If something is unclear, your assistant will reach out to you to clarify, guaranteeing that all meetings fit perfectly within your schedule. After you submit your preferences, scheduling a meeting will be as easy as emailing your assistant.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW MUCH DOES ESPER'S SERVICE COST?</h4>
        <p>Esper provides plans starting at $200/month to support your scheduling needs. Pricing varies based on the volume of scheduling tasks and additional features provided (such as a branded email address). We would be happy to speak with you about which plan best fits your needs. Join our waiting list, and we’ll be in touch soon!</p>
        <br>
