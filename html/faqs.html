        <h4>WHAT DOES ESPER PROVIDE?</h4>
        <p>Esper provides you with an assistant to handle all of your scheduling tasks. By using our own software platform that connects email and calendars, Esper Assistants quickly and efficiently schedule your meetings and provide you and your guests with the proper context and information so that everyone is prepared for a productive meeting.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DOES ESPER WORK?</h4>
        <p>Just include us in an email, and we’ll reach out to your peers and schedule a meeting that works for everyone. In the process, we’ll use your preferences and correspondences to gather context around the appointment and add a single event to your calendar.</p>
        <p>
        Most importantly, Esper Assistants use our powerful platform to efficiently organize executives’ calendars. As a result, we’re able to have an extremely fast turn around time for planning any meeting.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>WILL I NEED A NEW CALENDAR?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not – we’ll update any and all of the calendars you normally use, allowing you to have all of your appointments without lifting a finger.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHICH EMAIL PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED?</h4>
        <p>We currently only support emails hosted on Google Apps. However, we are in the process of developing our platform for iOS and Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DO I JOIN?</h4>
        <p>We’re currently inviting interested executives and assistants to join our beta program for a free trial. We will provide complete assistant support free of charge during the trial period, after which you will have the option to opt-in to our full service.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>OK, I SIGNED UP - WHAT NEXT?</h4>
        <p>When you sign up with Esper we ask that you fill out a short preference form so that your assistant can get to know you better. These preferences will be used as a guide to schedule all your meetings. If something is unclear your assistant will reach out to you to clarify, guaranteeing that all meetings fit perfectly within your schedule.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW MUCH DOES ESPER'S SERVICE COST?</h4>
        <p>Esper provides plans starting $200/month to support your scheduling needs. Pricing varies based on volume of scheduling tasks and additional features provided (such as a branded email address), and we would be happy to speak with you about what plan best fits your needs. Join our waiting list and we’ll be in touch soon!</p>
        <br>
