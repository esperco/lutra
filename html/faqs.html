        <h4>WHAT DOES ESPER PROVIDE?</h4>
        <p>By offloading mundane scheduling tasks to an Esper Assistant, you can maximize your own assistant's time on strategic tasks. If you don’t have an assistant, Esper will provide you with one to handle all of your scheduling needs. Esper Assistants use powerful, custom-built software that connects the inbox and calendar, allowing them to quickly manage your schedule and provide you and your guests with all of the context necessary to have a productive meeting.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DOES ESPER WORK?</h4>
        <p>Just include us in an email, and we’ll reach out to your peers to schedule a meeting that works for everyone. In the process, we’ll use your preferences, correspondences, and interactions with your existing EA to gather context, schedule the meeting, and add the event to your calendar.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WILL I NEED A NEW CALENDAR?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not. We’ll update any and all of the calendars you normally use.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHICH EMAIL PLATFORMS ARE SUPPORTED?</h4>
        <p>We currently support emails hosted on Google Apps. However, we are in the process of building support for Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW DO I JOIN?</h4>
        <p>We’re inviting all interested executives and assistants to join our beta program for a free trial. We will provide complete assistant support free of charge during the trial period, after which you will have the option to opt-in to our full service. <a href="signup.html"><b>Sign up here</b></a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT INFORMATION DOES MY ASSISTANT NEED?</h4>
        <p>When you sign up with Esper, we ask some simple questions about your scheduling preferences to help your Esper Assistant get to know you better. These preferences will be used as a guide to schedule all of your meetings. If something is unclear, your Esper Assistant will seek clarification from you or your existing EA, guaranteeing that all meetings fit perfectly within your schedule.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW WILL MY CURRENT EA AND MY ESPER ASSISTANT WORK TOGETHER?</h4>
        <p>Esper’s goal is to free your EA from scheduling tasks so that they can focus on strategic, high-level activities. Your EA will have complete oversight of every scheduling task and will be able to provide content and context when needed. We work with executive assistants on an individual basis to understand how we can best support them and their executive.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VIP AND BASIC PACKAGE?</h4>
        <p>The basic package includes 24/7 support for 30 meetings a month. In addition to constant email support, the VIP package includes an unlimited amount of scheduled meetings, group scheduling, and phone assistance. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>HOW MUCH DOES ESPER'S SERVICE COST?</h4>
        <p>Esper provides unlimited scheduling for $999/month. Join our waiting list, and we’ll be in touch soon!</p>
