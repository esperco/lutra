       <p>
         As a startup, we take on big challenges and find solutions
         with speed, thoughtfulness, and an iterative approach. We
         work hard but also understand the importance of sleep and
         wellbeing. Thatâ€™s why we start at 10 AM each morning, cater
         in local food for lunch and dinner, and reward ourselves
         with once-in-a-lifetime team trips, like our hike to the
         top of Half Dome.
       </p>
       <p>
         Functional programming (i.e. OCaml) underlies our technical
         approach, allowing our small team of engineers to create a
         product that can support millions of users. However, we
         still rely on Javascript, Java, and Objective-C &mdash; we
         believe in using the right tool for every job.
       </p>
       <p>
         We always enjoy getting in touch with like-minded people.
