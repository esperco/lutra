      <p>
         As a startup, we take on big challenges and find solutions with speed,
         thoughtfulness, and an iterative approach. We work hard but also
         understand the importance of sleep and well-being. That’s why we start
         at 10 AM each morning, cater in local food for lively discussions
         during lunch and dinner, play board games, walk across the street to
         see a movie on opening night, and reward ourselves with
         once-in-a-lifetime team trips, like our hike to the top of Half Dome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional, strongly-typed programming (i.e.
        <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>) underlies our
        technical approach, allowing our small team of engineers to create a
        product that can support millions of users. However, we also use
        Javascript, Java, and Objective-C &mdash; we believe in using the
        right tool for every job.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
        We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national
        origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status,
        or disability status.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also enjoy getting in touch with like-minded people.
        What about taking our little
