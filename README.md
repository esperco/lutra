Typescript Definitions
----------------------
The [typings](typings) directory contains various type defitions imported
from [our fork of the DefinitelyTyped library](https://github.com/esperco/DefinitelyTyped).
To add to these typings, you should download [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/)
with `npm install -g tsd` and call `tsd install [library] --save`.

If you want to write new definitions for open-source projects, please add to
our fork of the DefinitelyTyped repo and consider opening a pull request to the
main (borisyankov) DefinitelyTyped repo.
